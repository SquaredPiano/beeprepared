      "heading": "The Origin Story: From Shipwreck to Stoa",
      "main_idea": "Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Cyprus, whose personal disaster led him to philosophy and teaching in Athens.",
      "bullet_points": [
        "Zeno lost his wealth in a shipwreck near Athens around 300 BCE.",

      "heading": "Core Philosophy: The Pursuit of Virtue",
      "main_idea": "The fundamental goal of Stoicism is Eudaimonia (flourishing) achieved solely through cultivating virtue.",
      "bullet_points": [
        "Stoicism emphasizes virtue, tolerance, and self-control as the only true 'good'.",
        "External things (wealth, health, reputation) are morally neutral.",

      "heading": "The Dichotomy of Control: Focus on the Inside",
      "main_idea": "The most crucial Stoic practice is clearly separating what is within our power from what is outside of it.",

      ],
      "visual_cue": "A clear, dividing line chart titled 'What is Up To Me?', separating thoughts/intentions (control) from external events (no control).",
      "speaker_notes": "Epictetus taught that we should direct 100% of our effort towards the things we control—our intentions and efforts—and accept everything else. This radically minimizes anxiety and frees up emotional energy."

      "heading": "Wisdom and Temperance in Daily Life",
      "main_idea": "Practical Wisdom guides informed action, while Temperance ensures emotional and physical moderation.",

      ],
      "visual_cue": "Icon of a thoughtful person weighing options (Wisdom) next to a balanced scale (Temperance).",

      "visual_cue": "A depiction of a handshake (Justice) and a shield (Courage) overlapping.",
      "speaker_notes": "Stoicism is often mistakenly viewed as passive. In fact, it's highly active. Seneca, for example, argued fervently for humane treatment, even towards slaves, emphasizing shared humanity. Courage is required to live justly when it is unpopular."

      ],
      "visual_cue": "Dual portraits of Epictetus and Seneca.",
      "speaker_notes": "The diversity of these figures underscores the universal accessibility of the philosophy. Epictetus proved that true freedom is internal. Seneca showed that even those in power must constantly strive for ethical consistency."
