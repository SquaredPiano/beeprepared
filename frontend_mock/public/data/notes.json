His reading of Socrates inspired him to seek a path to happiness that was independent of external circumstances.\n\nStoicism is fundamentally a **life philosophy** designed to help individuals flourish ($eudaimonia$). Unlike some contemporaries, Stoics advocated for active engagement in society rather than withdrawal. It quickly became one of the most popular schools of Hellenistic philosophy, influencing Roman governance and morality.",

This requires accepting that certain events are predetermined and using our rational faculty (reason) to manage our reactions.\n\nEpictetus summarized the dichotomy of control: \"Some things are up to us and some things are not up to us.\" Mathematically, this division of agency can be seen as:\n\n$$ A = C \\cup U, \\quad C \\cap U = \\emptyset $$\n\nWhere $A$ is all experiences, $C$ is what we can control (our $prohairesis$), and $U$ is what is uncontrollable (externals). The primary focus must always be on $C$.\n\nFailure to adhere to this principle results in emotional distress, often manifested as fear, anger, or misplaced desire.",

This prevents us from being enslaved by pleasure.\n3.  **Justice ($Dikaiosyne$)**: Fairness, humane treatment, and treating all people with equity, extending even to those typically marginalized (e.g., Seneca's advocacy for slaves).\n4.  **Courage ($Andreia$)**: Not just bravery in battle, but moral courage in the face of fear, adversity, and unpopularity, focusing on integrity in daily life.\n\nThese virtues are considered interdependent; possession of one implies the possession of all others.",

Seneca, a wealthy advisor, used his philosophy to champion humane treatment, even toward his slaves, arguing for their intrinsic worth as fellow human beings.\n\nMarcus Aurelius, arguably the most famous Stoic, used his journals as a tool for ethical self-correction, enabling him to govern effectively during periods of extreme duress (e.g., the Marcomannic Wars and the Antonine Plague). His journals later influenced modern figures, such as Nelson Mandela, who reportedly found solace and guidance in them during his long imprisonment, utilizing the Stoic emphasis on inner freedom.\n\nThis historical relevance demonstrates the philosophy's non-sectarian appeal and its effectiveness in the face of profound hardship.",

The therapeutic focus is on disputing (D) the irrational beliefs (B).\n2.  **Logotherapy**: Viktor Frankl’s approach emphasizes finding meaning in life, even in the most difficult circumstances. This aligns perfectly with the Stoic commitment to exercising virtue and retaining inner freedom regardless of external constraints.\n\nUnderstanding Stoic logic provides practical tools for emotional regulation ($E_{reg}$) through the consistent application of reason ($R$):\n\n$$ E_{reg} \\propto R \\times (1 - U) $$\n\nWhere $U$ represents attachment to uncontrollable factors.",
