Hey! Brandon Sanderson here. Welcome to the 2025 lecture series. These are lectures that I give at my local university, Brigham Young University, about science fiction and fantasy writing. Every week, I'm going to have a new one for you. This week, we're doing mostly introductory material. I'm going to talk about my philosophy in teaching this class. I'm going to talk about the difference between a discovery writer and an outline writer. I'm going to talk about a lot of interesting philosophy about how to approach being a writer with the eye toward being a professional, as long as we're in this class. It's not how you have to do it, but it's what I'm going to assume for the hours that you're here with me. Join me here, and I will see you back every week, hopefully, for another lecture.

Hey! Welcome to class! Oh, I surprised you. This is How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy. If you're not here for science fiction and fantasy, you can stay. We'll convert you. We love having you here. What this class is, is Brandon lectures at you for approximately an hour and a half, I believe. We started this up with it being a normal 218 class, How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy. The class burgeoned. It grew as my notoriety grew to the point that people were packing in, and we had to move to a lecture hall. Hey, how are you doing? How are you doing? I'm doing all right.

These days it really is—and this is how I run it—a lecture series. Now, after this, there is the second class. I should have my 15 or 16 people who are in that class here this year. That class is by application only. We'll figure out what we're doing with you afterward. The rest of you are welcome to apply for that class. That one is by application only, and we do it every year after this class. What are we going to do in this class? I am going to come every week, and I am going to turn on a firehose of information. I'm going to blast you with this firehose of information, and you're going to try to drink some of it. That which you can't drink, you can hopefully come back and watch on the videos that we are posting this year on YouTube.

You're being recorded. Not much of you—only your laughter and maybe the backs of some of your heads. That's why we're in this new, fancier room. We have a camera that's going to be capturing their faces. Oh, your faces are on the camera too. You should have had to sign something that says we're going to make you internet famous, Nate. By the way, who here took the class last year? Nate finished a book! Nate finished a second book! He's actually finished three, which means he's one off from running a Kickstarter. [Joking. Joking. Joking.] Last year, he had expressed that he had trouble, as many authors do, getting really into a project, starting to write, and then losing momentum, revising the same chapter over and over again, and never finishing anything. Am I paraphrasing it right, Nate?

I started checking up on him every week and embarrassing him in front of class, and he was a very good sport. I'm happy to see you back, and congratulations. Well done. You're back, too, aren't you? Good to see you. Some of you I recognize. Do I recognize you? Yes. People take the class so often. You guys intimidate—Hey! They're all up here. Hey, I recognize you. That's Skar. He's annoying. You probably don't remember. I totally know your name. Elle. That's right, Elle. I told you I was going to remember your name. I promised I would at some point. You even put me in a whole book. Welcome, Elle. You told me that last time too. I spelled it differently though. E-L. E-L, not just the letter. Welcome, El. Good to see you again.

We will have lots of people running around doing video recordings. Ignore them. Pretend they're not here. What do we have? Because we're getting recorded this year, I'm going to try to do better to write on the board what we're going to talk about each week, and then actually keep to it. We'll see how much I deviate from that with various tangents, which I do love and enjoy. We are going to approach this class from—we'll talk about this later—a nuts and bolts approach. This shouldn't, hopefully, ruin your artistic expression. In fact, it should help elevate it. We'll talk about that. We are going to spend two weeks each on plot, setting, character, and the business of writing. Those are our core ideas that we'll cover.

I am usually gone at least one week, and I bring in guest lecturers. In the past, guest lecturers have focused on short story writing or on independent publishing. I'll try to get somebody who can cover a realm of publishing from a place of more expertise. On one metric, I'm the most successful independently published author ever. But that metric was trading on my already established traditionally published name. We'll see what happens with the Philosophy of the Class that week. That will cover nine of our weeks.

Several of our other weeks will be Q&A sessions. Usually, I plan to have two weeks on, say, plot, and then a Q&A on plot; two weeks on setting, then a Q&A on setting; two weeks on character, Q&A; two weeks on business, Q&A. That should basically cover the class. In there somewhere, I tend to try to squeeze in mini-lectures on revision and a mini-lecture on prose. We'll see what we can do with those things. Let's talk about the beginning idea: my philosophy for this class. What is my philosophy for teaching, and for teaching writing in particular? Writing is kind of hard to teach. Not to make my job sound more cool, but it's hard because you will learn more than I can teach you in this class. Hey, how are you doing?

You will learn more by writing your first book than myself or any person can possibly teach you. Writing as an art requires work and effort. Everything requires work and effort. But the thing about a lot of artistic pursuits is that you need to start exploring with your style. Hey, you're back too. Good to see you. Exploring with your style. Seeing how it goes. Revising. Trying different things. As you explore writing, you will get better and better, and you will know how to use the tools that people like myself give you. You will also know which tools to ignore. One of the key philosophies I have is that writing advice is only as good as its ability to help you individually. You will get bad advice for you. You will get bad advice for you from me in this class.

I try hard not to give you too much of that. But the thing is, writing is so individual that what works for some writers doesn't work for others. For example, the one I often use because it hit me when I was young and I was working: I was reading a book by Orson Scott Card where he talked about writing, and in it he talked about how important an outline was to his writing, and without it, his writing would become a disaster. I then later read an essay by Stephen King—it may have even been in *On Writing*, his famous writing book—where he talks about how an outline is the great destroyer of stories. If you have an outline for your story, it's going to ruin your story. These are polar opposites. Can you do both?

The answer is yes. Most everyone in this room is going to be some mix of what George R. R. Martin calls a gardener versus an architect. He's very good with words, and that's one of his descriptions that I love. He says some writers are an architect: they build themselves a structure for their story, like a house, and then they hang a story upon it. Other writers, he says, are like a gardener: they go out in the garden and they nurture something as it starts to grow, and then they see what it becomes. You might have heard the term "pantsing" for writing. People use that. The truth is that most writers are somewhere in between those two extremes.

But you won't know where you are, and indeed what a given project requires, until you try both of them and make your own Frankenstein monster of a style and a process out of the things that everyone tells you and what you discover on your own. That monster will grow and change through your career, and you will do different things. Why am I sometimes going to give you bad advice? It's because it works for 90% of authors but you're the 10%. Or it might be the advice that is good for you 20 years from now when you've changed as an author and you're like, "Hey, I remember that thing. Let's try that." But right now, it could be destructive.

Our philosophy—my philosophy—is to treat you like a chef and not a cook. Those who have been in this class before know I love this metaphor. What does this metaphor mean? In my definition, a cook is someone like me when it comes to baking, who can follow a recipe. If I follow the recipe, usually I'll get what I'm trying to make, and it usually tastes something like what I'm trying to make. The problem is, if something goes wrong, I have no idea why it went wrong or what I could have done to change it. I have no idea what temperature does to baking, only that the page says bake it at 325, and if I do that, it usually turns out. I don't know the difference between baking soda and baking powder, except that the page says use one and not the other, and if you mix them up, it's bad. That is what I will term a cook.

What is a chef? A chef is a person who can tell you, "When you add this ingredient, it does this." A chef is a person who can taste something and be like, "Oh, this is what went wrong. Let's try it this way next time and see if it improves it." A chef is someone who can take the various styles of baking that different people use and apply them to their own process and create new things—not from a recipe, but by using the knowledge of previous recipes to create masterful new works. I want you to be a chef when it comes to writing. I want you to learn all the tools and processes. I want you to try them. I want you to work with them. As you do, learn how to create the effect you want to have with your stories as you write and finish them, rather than the effect other people say you should have. Your goals can be your own.

I'm slightly out of order here because let's talk about being a pro versus being a non-pro writer. It is okay—in fact, it is wonderful—to be a nonprofessional writer. You can be in this class for any reason. You could have wandered in accidentally, seen that there were people here, and taken a seat, you weirdo. You're welcome. You're welcome here. You can be here because you think, "That Sanderson guy, maybe if I take his class I'll get a book signed." You shouldn't be doing that, but I'll make you learn anyway, and that's good for you. You might be here because you think, "I need to have a certain number of writing credits, and this is the class that's in the evening that I can take." You might be here because you want to be a better GM. You might be here because you just love the process.

Or you might be here, as the majority of you probably are, because you think, "Maybe I could become a professional science fiction/fantasy writer." Those are all valid reasons to be here. I would guess the most common types are those who want to be a professional, and those who would like to learn to write a good book now and then as a hobby. Those are my most common students. Wonderful. I think writing is good for you. One of the things you're going to have to confront, when you're writing stories and you tell people about it, they're going to ask you a question. Have you been asked this question? What is it? "Are you published?" "Are you published?" "What are you going to do with this?" "How soon till you can take me out to dinner with the money you make from your books?"

We live in a society that likes to approach things from a utilitarian perspective. There are advantages to that. There are advantages to my mother, when I was 16, discovering that I wanted to be a writer, and saying, "That's nice, dear. You should be a doctor." I said, "But doc—" She said, "Doctors have a lot of free time. You know how doctors are always golfing? You could be a doctor who writes fantasy novels instead of golfing and also feed your family." She really wanted a doctor, and she got none out of her four children. No doctors. She got me. She got my brother who's in computer programming—that's close to being a doctor. He got the closest. She got a teacher. And she got an artist/fashion designer/charity organizer. That's Jane, who runs Lightweaver for me.

She got no doctors. She got none married to doctors. But she loves us anyway. There is an advantage to people saying that because you do need to ask those questions. But our society treats art too utilitarianly. It doesn't look at the primary purpose of art, which I sincerely believe is making the artist's life more enriched. It is to make your life better by creating something. When you go play basketball, unless you happen to have a Wemby-esque height, people are probably not going to ask you after your game in the church gym, especially if you look more like me. They're not going to say, "So, when are you going to the NBA?" They won't. But they will ask you when you're going to sell your writing. They're going to ask you if you're published.

That's okay. But I want you to understand that's not why you *have* to write. In fact, it's probably not why you *should* write. Writing is good for you. Expressing yourself is good for you. Creating art is good for you. That all said, we are going to pretend when you walk through those doors that every one of you is in the category I mentioned that wants to be making a full-time living as a science fiction and fantasy novelist within the next 10 years. The reason for that is: all the other advice I would give you—to be a better GM, or to be better at writing in your journal, or to be fulfilled writing a book every 20 years, or every five years for your sisters like Jane Austen did—all of that advice is circumscribed in the advice I would give to the aspiring professional.

I want to give you all the possible tools that I can so that you can become that professional if someday you decide that you want to. But let's take a moment to look at it realistically—probably the only time in this class that we will do that. Making a living as a professional novelist, or as a professional musician working on the highest record label touring level, or as a fine artist not working in commercial illustration—these jobs are hard. Not that they are any harder to do than other types of jobs, but they are harder to make a living at than other kinds of jobs.

As a writer, there are lots of options open to you, and I'm sure the university will tell you what they are. Skar wrote for a hearing aid company for how many years? Ten. Ten years writing copy in the hearing aid company for their hearing aid books about, you know, how to operate the hearing aids. You can tell the enthusiasm in his voice. If you don't know Skar, Skar works at Dragonsteel. He is one of my executive assistants. Becky is the other one; she's back there. They are here to facilitate making things happen and to get me in the place where I'm supposed to be at the time I'm supposed to be there. Dan, a friend of mine, wrote for the newsletter for a scrapbooking company. There are lots of those kinds of jobs. Writing fiction and making a living at it is hard.

It's not as hard as they told me when I was taking classes like this when I was young. It's not as hard as my mom thought. She would have told you it's one in a million. If you had asked other people, they'd be like one in 10,000, whatever. I took this class in 1999. Yeah, I know. I used to think of myself as the young guy. Now these are the young people over here. When I took this class in 1999 from Dave Wolverton, who has since passed on, in that class was myself, Dan Wells who went on to become a professional novelist, Stacey who became a professional editor, and Peter who became a professional editor, as well as two people I would list as semi-pros. That's four professionals in that class of around 30 people.

That's pretty good. The odds in my 15-person class have generally been one to one-half of a person every year going professional, depending on your definition of "going pro." More than one will get a book published professionally. But one to half a person a year—so one every two years—will go on to make a significant portion of their living from writing. Those are about the odds we've had. Janci took my class, and she went full pro. Brian McClellan took my class. He went full pro. There's a bunch of them; I can't list them all right now. That's not because I'm such a great teacher. I hope that I'm good. But it's more along the lines of: if you are seriously dedicated to this and willing to invest 10 years in it, you've probably got more than a one in 20 shot of making a significant portion of your income from writing, rather than one in a million. That does not count the fact that a lot of people are going to give up before then, so it's probably better than one in 20. Those are better odds than people pretend.

You would not have thought that. Let's acknowledge that of the people who went pro that are my friends or in that class, only one of them is regularly hitting the *New York Times* best-seller list. But you can make a living without doing that or significantly contribute to your income. That said, if you went and took a class in the Computer Science Department and the professor got up and said, "I think maybe one in 20 of you can actually make some of your living at this; maybe one in 50 will be fully professional," you would leave. You would be like, "I am going to chemical engineering." Oh, the chemical engineers. They have a 90-something-percent placement rate. Do you guys know what it is? It used to be the highest at BYU, which is why I used that one as a joke.

Are you chemical engineers? Yes. My freshman roommate was a chemical engineer. If you've ever read the *Mistborn* books, Captain Conrad is based off of Tom Conrad, a good friend of mine still. He went on to work for Intel. He is a glorified sewage treatment plant engineer, because he cleans their water for Intel. That's his job. He loves cleaning water. He gets the dirty water and figures out how to separate all the stuff out that you can sell for money, and then make the rest of the stuff nontoxic so you can dispose of it, or purify it so that it can be used elsewhere. That's Tom's job. He's very good at it. It's good to bring up chemical engineering because when I was in school, taking this class, Tom was getting put through the wringer. You people, I'm so sorry. He would come back and say, "I got a 61 on my test." And I'd be like, "Oh! I'm in the arts. We don't look at those numbers." And he'd say, "Oh, no. I was second highest in the class." Yeah, we talked about sonnets and shared our feelings, and all got A's.

But if you want to be going professional in the next 10 years, you're going to have to pretend you're in the Chemical Engineering Department, but for writing. My philosophy, again, is to encourage an aggressive (whatever your definition of that is) writing schedule during your early years in order for you to learn your process. Your job as a writer right now, if you have not finished at least three novels—I'm just pulling that out of the air, maybe five—I sold my sixth. Dan sold his sixth. You sold your seventh. If you haven't done that many, that's not where you are. Your job is not to sell books, even if you want to be a professional. Your job is to write enough books to learn your process and what works for you.

This is where the bad advice comes in. Once in a while, there's a stupid Pat Rothfuss who writes a brilliant book their first time and then revises it a ton, because he did—sweat and tears. You know Pat. He revised it maybe to insane levels. But once in a while, there's a stupid Pat Rothfuss who's brilliant at the start and just writes a really great book. *Harry Potter* was a first book. *Twilight* was a first book. *Name of the Wind* was a first book. *Elantris* was my sixth. *Mistborn* was my 14th. I find a lot more of those than I find first books that sell. Most of the people I know whose first book got published kind of wish that they had written several more books before they published it so that when they published that first book, they already knew their style. This way, when the weight of deadlines hit them, they were already practiced at consistently writing.

If you are lucky enough to get published, you're suddenly going to have deadlines. You're suddenly going to have to write while the entire world is critiquing what you've done. You're somehow going to have to keep writing as you stress about whether or not your books are selling copies, worrying they're not selling enough copies, and trying to deal with publicity and all of the headaches and heartaches that come from being a professional. If you have not spent years practicing so that writing and the habits of it are secondhand, that part is so much harder, so very much harder. If you have not finished several novels, I heard early on that your first five books are generally crap. It was good advice for me because I said, "Oh, I don't have to stress about this for five books." And I wrote five books, and they were mediocre.

I said, "I love epic fantasy. I've spent this time learning this." And then I sat down, and I wrote *Elantris*, and it sold. It still took a couple of years, but it sold. Who knows? That was definitely the right advice for me. Is it the right advice for you? I don't know. But I'm telling you right now, you should probably approach your writing as you might approach playing the piano, and your first books are learning your scales. This can be really hard for some people. It can be hard generally for most people, knowing that this beautiful thing that you're working on—this baby that you've cherished—you might have cherished this baby since you were a teenager, thinking, "I'm going to write this book someday." You might have written sketches of your characters and ideas for plot lines for that book you're going to write in your notebooks at school, as I did.

You may have this book that built over many years. You might run into the situation upon writing it that suddenly your baby is ugly. It's here and it's ugly, and what do you do? It's even worse than the baby being ugly: the baby—this book—was perfect in your mind. It was gorgeous and beautiful. And then you made it ugly through your clumsy fingers being unable to accomplish what you wanted to accomplish. This is very deadly to new writers because they get stopped when their skill isn't up to their aspirations yet. You need to push through that and keep writing. You need to learn early on that the product of your writing time is yourself. You are the artwork. The time you spend writing will change you. It will make you better at expressing your ideas. You'll have a wonderful time; it's just wonderful writing. But you will also grow as a person. You will become more empathetic. All of these things will happen to you. The product of your writing time is you. You are the piece of art.

As you get better and better at that, that time spent making yourself better does start producing things that hopefully you can sell. My philosophy on artistic expression is: while you are writing the book, the artist should be in control. You should be making the decisions that the artist thinks are genuinely the best decisions for that story and those characters. The moment you finish that book, there should be a second person inside of you who takes the artist, shoves them in a closet, locks the door, takes the manuscript, and runs away cackling. This person then figures out every mercenary way to exploit that book for profit that is legal in our system, so that you can let that person back out and they will have enough food to eat so that they can go and be artistic the next time. That's the perspective we'll take in the class.

*Question:* Should the second person worry about how the artist feels about what they've done with their baby? *Answer:* Yes. You definitely should. I'm exaggerating a little in that. Your artistic integrity maintains. You are the same person. There are certain things that you will not do as an artist with your book. Yes, absolutely. I'm just talking about this idea: the business person shouldn't be in charge when you're writing. But as you finish the book, learning the business and letting the business person take charge is a good idea. Definitely do not compromise your artistic integrity through revisions because of what the business person thinks. But sometimes you might. Let me give you an example.

John Scalzi wanted to be a novelist. He's a very good writer, a good friend of mine. He had been a blogger for a long time. He decided, "I'm going to be a novelist." So he went to the bookstore and said, "What's selling right now?" He picked up a few books and said, "These look like they're selling. I'll write one of these." Then he went home, and the artist took over, and he wrote one of those. I wouldn't say that John compromised his artistic integrity, but there definitely was a back and forth between the business person and the artist when it came to choosing that project, and how he chose to release it and sell it, and things like that. I think there should be communication between the two sides of your brain. But I do think that letting the artist make the artistic decisions and letting the business person then learn how to sell that book rather than dictate what the book should be is generally the way you'll want to go. Once in a while, that's bad advice. It might have been bad advice for John. Other questions on what I've said so far? Go ahead.

*Question:* If our first five books are going to be not so great, should we spend a lot of time revising them? *Answer:* Yes. Here's why: Revision is a difficult skill to learn, on par with learning to write a book. While I was not selling books and getting very close, I learned a lesson that some of my friends who were creating the best artwork were better revisers than they were writers. If I were you, there's an argument for just putting aside the first book, writing the second one, and then coming back later and maybe revising the first, or maybe not even ever touching the first. But the truth is, a lot of people's second books are publishable. It might be better if you think you're going to write five and then publish number two. But most people wish they'd written a couple, even if they are starting off as a genius.

Revision is a really important thing to learn. I would say the reason it took me as long as it did to sell *Elantris* after I wrote it—it came out in 2005, and I wrote it in '98—was because I hadn't learned revision. I wrote those first five books, and I never did a second draft. I wrote them, figuring the next book would always be better, so why not just write that. This is a classic trap. I'm more of an outliner, and this happens more often to outliners than it does to discovery writers: they think, "I'm excited by the next book. I'm going to go write that." Discovery writers have the opposite problem. They tend to over-revise. They write a chapter and then they revise it; they write a chapter and then they revise it. They go back and revise the first one again. Then they write Chapter 3, and then they revise the other two. Then they need to revise Chapter 3, and they never get anywhere.

Oh, we've got another Nate up there! Your name isn't Nate, is it? This is funny because last year I was telling a story like this, and I had a guy in my writing group whose name was Nate who did this. And this guy said, "I do that. My name is Nate!" So this does tend to be more of a problem. I will say, in my experience, those writers who constantly revise the early chapters don't tend to make it, because having 80 first chapters doesn't get you very far. Now, you could be a fantastic short story writer. Short stories don't earn any money anymore. It's hard to make a living at short story writing, in fact, kind of impossible, unless you're also doing lecture series and being a professor. Yes, learn revision. It's really important. By the way, you were in the class before too, weren't you? Good to see you. We'll go here, and then we'll get some in the back.

*Question:* When you first started writing, and you weren't good at it, what was it, especially when you knew you had to practice and spend free time when you could be doing something else, that got you to go back and write? *Answer:* What made me write? What gave me the motivation? There are a couple of things. When I was brand new at this, I saw that if I didn't learn to write, I was going to have to get a job that I did not enjoy as much, because I genuinely enjoyed writing. I came to BYU as a chemical engineering—actually, I was bioengineering, something like that—because my mother convinced me that engineers got—I was biochemistry, that's what it was—that engineers got scholarships, and she still wanted a doctor so badly. I came to BYU, and they threw me in the "weeder" classes for chemistry, which I actually really appreciate because they taught me I did not want to be doing chemistry every day. Oh, boy, did I not want to be doing chemistry.

I went on a mission to Korea and thought, "I'm on a different continent from chemistry! Oh, it's so nice!" But when I would sit down to write, hours could pass, and I wouldn't know what time it was. That doesn't mean that writing was easy. Usually starting is hard. Or if I hit a rough patch, I would still give up or things like that. So I still needed this motivation. But that was a key sign to me: I loved the busy work of writing so much more than other things. The thing that worked best for me is that I would start keeping a spreadsheet with the amount I'd written each day and my goal. If I hit my goal, then I didn't have to worry about it anymore. I was making the progress that I needed to, and I could go play *Halo*.

I could go do whatever I wanted because I had hit my goal for the day. I often made the goal difficult to hit but not impossible. It wasn't actually hard; it was just that I had to actually work. Most days I would double that goal, because it was something like 1,000 words. It was enough that I actually had to sit down and do it, but once I got into it, I would keep going. I put that on my spreadsheet, and I watched those numbers counting up. It worked for me like the progress bar in an MMO for getting your next level works. I thought, "Hey, I will hit 25% soon. Wow! I will hit 50%! I'm almost done!" Every day was a balance of making me feel like, "Man, I've got my work done. I can relax. I don't have to stress about this." My job right now isn't to publish books. My job is to write those first five books and to learn from them. So if I hit my 1,000 words today, I'm on my path. I've done basically all that I can do realistically with a normal person's mental health, in order to hit that goal in 10 years. And it worked.

Granted, I'm going to get to your question up here. Let's talk about survivorship bias. We're recording this this year, so I think every person entering into a creative or even a professional field needs to know about survivorship bias, because there are a whole lot of grifters out there who coast on it. Survivorship bias is the fact that our brains are more likely to weigh the words of someone who's been successful, even if their success was random, than someone who has not been. If we didn't know that flipping coins was random, and we had a competition where everyone in here flipped coins until we had one person left that had flipped heads the whole time, everyone in this room would be asking them for advice next time. They might even go on the guru circuit, earning big money writing books about flipping coins, about how you do it, and their process. They might even name it and come up with a YouTube course that you can pay for. That's survivorship bias. We cannot say exactly what contributed to my success. This is why I try to give you lots of tools. That worked for me. I am a survivor of that system working. Who knows? But that's the best I can give you. I liked the way you phrased your question: What, for me, kept me going? And that's what kept me going.

Now, something else you need to hear about. What time is it? Okay, I've got time left. I have another class, but we've gotten through almost all of this, so I can do lots of questions. Let's tell you the story of Brandon almost giving up. Some of you have heard this story before. In this story, I am applying to grad schools and getting rejected from all of them. NYU, rejected. Columbia, rejected. Iowa, rejected. Everybody rejected me. I had written, at the time, around 12 novels, and I hadn't sold any. My father would call me and give me father-speak for "I am very concerned" by saying, "Son, your mother's very concerned." That's father-speak. A little interpretation for you if you ever get that.

They were worried, both of them, that I was going to end up begging for beans on the side of the road because instead of becoming a doctor, I had decided to be a science fiction novelist. And they were kind of right. As I talked about earlier, having a backup plan is a good idea in a career where one out of 20 talented people who work very hard for 10 years are going to make a living. Nineteen of them won't. Janci will tell you that it took her, even after she started selling books, over a decade to start earning what people would consider even close to a livable income. I think the first year she made enough to live on by itself with her writing was the year she co-authored a book with me. She is very good at self-publishing. She knows her stuff. So it's good to have a backup plan. I didn't have one.

Eventually, I got into BYU's graduate program. I did get into BYU. Everyone else rejected me. I went through one round of all the top schools; they all rejected me. Then I went to the second-tier schools and BYU, and of them, only BYU let me in for grad school. You don't usually want to go to grad school in the same place that you went to undergrad, which is why I applied everywhere else first. But I was only applying to the schools that if I got a degree from, I could then go on to get a job as a writer. Because BYU, at the time, didn't have an MFA. An MFA (Master of Fine Arts) was considered the degree you needed to be a professional teacher in creative writing. Getting a Master's from BYU in creative writing—my parents didn't know it—at that point would not do anything for me becoming a professor. It was virtually useless as a step to being a professor because it wasn't an MFA. They now have one, and their program has gained reputation because of that.

So those who are in it now, don't panic. But back then it really couldn't do anything. That said, Andi was in my class, and she's a professor at BYU right now, and she's really good. I don't think she got an MFA, though, did she? She was in my class when it wasn't—we didn't get the F. We just had an MA. I got into BYU. But my parents were calling me, and I thought, "Oh, man. I'm stalling. What am I doing with my life? I can't teach." I went to class the first day as a creative writing major, and Lance was teaching the class. Does anyone know if Lance retired? Lance Larson? He's still here. You said he retired! You're wrong! Lance was the Poet Laureate of Utah. He's a very good teacher, very good poet. He was in charge of graduate students in the Master's program in creative writing, or in just the Master's of English program.

He got up on the first day for your "Here you're a grad student now. Let's talk about it" session and said, he pulled out a thing and said, "Here is the CV"—which is like a resume for students, for those online who might not know—"of someone who got into a top-tier school for a Ph.D. and went on and became a professor in English." And it went to the floor. He said, "They were in every journal. They worked with this many professors on these projects. They spent something like 40 hours a week outside of school working in order to build their CV so that they could get into a top school, so that that school could then propel them into a career. That's what you're going to need to do if you want to become a professor at a prestigious university on a tenure track." I looked at that and said, "I cannot write books and do that. So I'm not going to do that."

I didn't. But I didn't have a backup. I had to, at that moment, confront: "What do I do? Do I give up? Do I go get a real job?" I was working a graveyard shift at a hotel so I could write at work, overnight. It worked very well for me. It was bad advice for Isaac, a friend of mine who's now at my company, who tried to do that. He is not a night person, and it did not work for him. I looked at this and thought, "Am I going to stop writing?" Looking seriously and honestly at my heart, I said, "No. Whatever I end up doing, I'm not going to stop writing. This is who I am. I'm going to keep writing. And if I'm age 90 and I never sell a book, and my books are only for my family and my friends, then I'm a success. That's the success I can control, and I'm going to do that."

I had been doing everything I was supposed to do. I'd been submitting. This was when George R. R. Martin first got big, and grimdark was the new hotness. Brandon is not grimdark. I tried. It was not—I tried writing grimdark, and it turned into the story of a grimdark assassin who found hope and love. I'm not even kidding. Grimdark is just not my thing. Darkness in a world? Great. But not my thing. I sat down and said, "Well, the publishers keep telling me I'm writing books too long." They wanted shorter books. What they were really hunting, those of you who know your fantasy history, they wanted George's aesthetic, but they wanted it to be cheaper to publish.

Here's some economics of books for you. A 400,000-word book, which is the length of the *Stormlight* books (*Game of Thrones* is even longer sometimes), is four times more expensive to edit, significantly more expensive to print, significantly more expensive to ship. To the bookstores, it takes up the shelf space of four 100,000-word books. If you can put three books on the shelf or one book, which one do you want to put on the shelf? The problem is the way the economics of entertainment work in our world: you don't charge much more for longer entertainment. Movies cost about the same no matter what length they are. Books maybe go up a dollar. But a *Stormlight* book, if a normal paperback is $8, a *Stormlight* book in paperback should, for the amount of money and time and all of these things, probably cost $25. But we can't do that.

They don't like long books. They're better with them now that eBooks are a thing, but audiobooks are still more expensive to produce. Anyway, they wanted Joe Abercrombie. They wanted George R. R. Martin—a grimdark aesthetic but short. I was the worst for them then. I was long, and I had a hopeful epic aesthetic. The big hotness was low magic, and I was like, "There are 30 magic systems." This was the era when people didn't even use the word "magic system" the same way they do now. They didn't know what to do with me. I got all these reactions. I remember walking up to someone who rejected me and saying, "Thank you for the rejection. Do you have any advice?" It was a form rejection. He said, "Read the first chapter of *Game of Thrones* and write something like that." Steve Saffel at Del Rey. That's exactly what he told me.

So I thought, "All right. I'm going to write what I want. I'm not going to care. They tell me to write short? I'm going to write the biggest darn book!" They tell me low magic? No, no, no! And I wrote *The Way of Kings*. *The Way of Kings Prime*. As I was finishing that book is when *Elantris* sold. I still remember that belly of the whale, if you want to use your writing metaphors, that long, dark tea time of the soul (a Dirk Gently/Douglas Adams quote). That moment was really, really helpful for me because I had gone through making the hard decision that I was going to write for the rest of my life *before* I became one of the most famous writers in the world. That was really handy to have made that decision before I sold and things like that. Tangents, I warned you about those. Do we have time left? Question back there. Hit me. I'm going to do a rapid fire round. I'm going to actually do them fast.

*Question:* If you're too attached to a world you built and don't want to go to the effort to jump ship and worldbuild a new thing and plan all these new things, would you say it's detrimental, or is it fine to still write five books in the same setting or the same world? *Answer:* I think that's good. That's great. Totally worth doing. The question is, let's say you want to write five books, but you don't want to abandon all your worldbuilding. It's totally okay to write those all in the same world. Now, there's a gambit for you here. You can do a "Sanderson," and write five different books with five different protagonists, just sharing some of the worldbuilding. It's more like an Anne McCaffrey; she used to do things like that. Or you can do a *Temeraire*. Naomi Novik wrote four of those, I think—maybe three or four—straight in a series. She just wrote those books without selling any of them. Why this is a gambit is you cannot send Book 2 of a series to an editor, or sell it to independent publishing, until you've sold Book 1. If they reject Book 1, you can't send them Book 2. But if they're in the same world, you can. But if it's a sequel, you can't.

She put all her eggs in the same basket, but when *Temeraire* sold, the publishers knew they had gold on their hands because they had three finished books, and maybe a fourth. They put an enormous marketing campaign behind that. You won't understand how big a deal this is because you're all young, but some of you who are not quite so young will. Her cover blurbs on her first three books were Stephen King, Anne McCaffrey, and Terry Brooks. They sent all three books to all of them and they said, "All three are done? Well, I'm going to read them." And they cover blurbed them. It was amazing. Then she stomped me at the Hugo Awards for Best New Author because of that, and she deserved it. So anyway, there's your gambit. Writing all in the same world but not direct sequels is kind of the best of both. If that appeals to you, totally do that. It's what Rachel did. It worked for her.

*Question:* I was wondering, if you have a world that you're incredibly proud of and you've been working on for years, how do you escape the fact of using the first four or five books to throw those away so you can get to that sixth one? *Answer:* You've got a world you've been working on. You're so excited by it. You don't want to throw it away because it's your baby. You have a couple of options. Number one is: write that first book, get it out of your system. Know that you're probably just going to come back and write it better. That's the one I kind of recommend. *The Way of Kings Prime* didn't sell. There was stuff wrong with it. Years later, when I had more experience, I just wrote it up from scratch. Having a book that was a rough draft of the book I wanted to write, where I could see all the flaws with my current experience and write a much better version—I didn't revise it, I just started on page one—it's almost like I had an outline that was the wrong version of the book. It was really handy. It is part of why *The Way of Kings* is so strong as a series, because I know stuff about that world I don't know about others because I wrote a whole book that I threw away. So that's what you can do.

Another thing people do is that ideas are cheap. This is what you will learn as a writer. The ability to take ideas and make them great—and you're going to be my last question, so I'll get to you—is what people are looking for. Two stories for you. Maybe one; we'll see how much time I have. There is a writer who was hanging out on some forums and arguing with some people, and he took this stance. He was a new writer, unpublished. He said, "I think ideas are cheap." And the other person said, "No, no, no. Ideas are what make science fiction and fantasy. If you don't have good ideas, then you've got nothing." And the first writer said, "I tell you what. Give me your three worst ideas." Or your two worst ideas. It was two, I think. I asked him this at dinner, and it's true. I had heard it apocryphally before, but he confirmed it to me. You can ask him in person. He said, "Give me your two worst ideas." They said, "All right. Pokémon meets the lost Roman legion."

And Jim Butcher took that, and he wrote a book series called *Codex Alera*. They're fantastic. In the hands of a great writer (great being someone who's practiced a bunch), you can take basically any idea and make gold from it. A writer with good ideas but not the skill is like playing piano. We've mentioned playing piano. The other story is, if we had someone come up here who'd been practicing piano for a few months and someone who had been practicing for 20 years, how long do you think it would take you to tell which is which? A very short amount of time. It's the same thing in writing. Editors, readers, they can tell if you've put that time into it. So ideas are cheap. Find some idea—a writing prompt. Mash it together with another idea and add the plot line of a film that you love that's in a different genre, and just write that book.

You'll think, "I'm going to write *The Godfather*. I love *The Godfather*. Except it's mice, and the magic system is magic cheese." You write that book, and that gives you your practice. You will then discover that ideas kind of are cheap, and you'll get some practice in. Then you save that book until later on. Either of those are perfectly viable. Last question. *Question:* How do you make yourself get to the point of just rewriting a story? I've written some novels, but they need rewrites, and I don't know how to make myself do that. *Answer:* How do you force yourself to revise?

Good question. How do you make yourself revise? I am there with you. I hate revision. It's my least favorite part of the whole process, and that's why it took me so long. I am really good at revision. People hear this and assume I'm bad at it. The things that you're bad at, that you have to force yourself to learn or you won't be able to succeed professionally, tend to end up as your strengths. I know. That's hard, and I don't want to do it. It's like a mental burnout. Well, helpful for this is learning whether you respond to carrots, or sticks, or something else. What makes you consistently do the things you want to have done? There are probably other things in your life you want to have done that you are able to get yourself to do, whether it's getting up in the morning, going to the gym, or reading scriptures. Whatever it is, what do you have that you have built a habit out of already? Number one, what made you do that? And number two, can you bundle your habits?

If there's something you already do every day, you might think, "Every day I go and I get my favorite dirty cola from the random dirty cola place that also sells cookies, because why not all the diabetes in one place? I know I do that on the way home from school. I am going to stop in that shop, and I am going to revise for only 30 minutes. Then when I get home, I get to do something else that I find fun." That's what we call bundling, when you group something you don't want to do with something you've already built a habit to do, so that the thing you want to have done also becomes a habit. That works very well. Learning whether you respond to, for me, counting up—I can see the percentages—and small bites. Or whether some people binge, thinking, "I don't like revision, so I'm going to take this week that I'm off school in the summer, and I only revise. I don't get to go do anything else. I do it for 12 hours a day. Then I collapse. At the end of the week, I'm done, and I get to take the summer off. Then I'll start writing a new book when the Fall semester starts."

Your job as a new writer is to figure out what triggers these things and makes them work in your mind. Helpful for me is to make a revision guide. If you're an outliner naturally, which you might be if you don't like revision, having an outline for your revision that has targeted goals, kind of like—have you ever done any computer programming? A tiny, tiny bit. In programming, you might have a bug list, starting with your most important bugs. You think, "In this book, I've gotten feedback this character doesn't work. Here's a plan for fixing the character. It's my most important thing. The main goal in this revision is to fix that character. If I have room in my brain for a second goal, here's the second most important thing. I'm going to find three places to foreshadow this or to add a scene that fixes this problem." Then you do a revision, checking things off that list so you feel like you're making accomplishments, and you're basically killing bugs in your bug report. That tends to work for some people as well, particularly if they are naturally an outliner, having an outline. But to do that, you need to get feedback. And to get feedback, we're going to talk about writing groups. Segue! Yay! Welcome.

Speaking of segue. By the way, I used to think that S-E-G-U-E was short for a longer word, and that the shortened version was "seg," and people would just write it. Did anyone else have this? Like, why does that word say "segue?" French! Oh, you Normans. You Normans came in. You took our nice Germanic language that liked to crunch and kill and eat, and instead, we had rendezvous. And we didn't give up; we surrendered. Now we have two words for everything, one Latinate and one Germanic. It's actually really good for writers because the Latinate words naturally sound very upscale to us. If you can learn to watch for the Germanic words—because those were the lower level words back in the Middle English era, and the Norman/Latin words were the high class—that's still around in our language. If you say, "I surrender," that indicates education. If you say, "I give up," that indicates lower class. You can use that as a writer, so it's actually a useful thing. But it is annoying. Writing groups.

Writing groups aren't for everyone. In fact, writing groups can ruin your book. Learning to take feedback is important for the majority of writers. Writing groups are one of the ways that we can do that. I am able, in my class, to do it in a controlled situation where it will not ruin people's books. I put a TA in every writing group, and the TA knows how to make sure that no one ruins each other's books. It is a good tool to try. Part of the reason for this is, when I took this class in 1999, I formed a writing group with four people: me, Dan Wells, Peter Ahlstrom, and Ben. Dan and I went on to become professionals. He found an editor, I sold to that editor, and then he sold to that editor, and we both went full time. Peter became a full-time editor at Tokyopop, and then I hired him to be my Editorial VP at Dragonsteel. All three of us went on to become professionals, and we are three of the four people from that class who went on to be professionals.

Part of that was because I was in this class and we were reading writing samples, and I zeroed in on Dan and said, "He's a good writer. I'm going to put him in a writing group with me." He said, "My friend Ben wants to join." Ben's a CS guy. He's our friend. He doesn't really write, but we make fun of him on my podcast. Then Peter was at the magazine with us, and I knew that Peter had a really good editorial eye. I thought, "I'm going to put him in the writing group because he's an editor and he knows what he's doing." So I specifically picked out the two people in the class that I thought were most likely to make it, and I formed a writing group with them. I was really good at picking them out, apparently. Another reason is the same reason that Tolkien and Lewis were in the same writing group. Success breeds success. Writing groups from my class that stick together often do give each other help and a leg up. While writing groups aren't for everyone, I do think they're worth trying.

I'm going to give you today the best inoculation against writing groups ruining your writing so that you can try them out if you would like. After this class, if you would like me to split you into writing groups, I will do so. If you don't want to be in a writing group, then you can leave and laugh at us all with your other cool writing group with cooler friends. Here are a couple of simple rules that if you follow, will help a ton. Number one: if you are a discovery writer, be very careful about taking any advice for your book until after you have finished said book and are working on a different one. This is because people who tend to discover their story can be taken over by the whims of other people giving feedback too early.

Stephen King is the quintessential discovery writer. One of the reasons he doesn't like writing groups (which he doesn't) is because they will do this to him. One of the reasons he doesn't like outlines is because if he writes an outline, he feels like he's already discovered the book, and his enthusiasm and excitement for that book vanishes. Both are perfectly valid ways to be a writer. This is why it's important to understand these things. If you are a discovery writer, try not to submit too early, or if you do, be aware of what can happen if someone hijacks your book. I had someone in a writing group once submit a chapter, and we gave some feedback. They submitted another chapter, and it was wildly different, but it was in the same book.

The third chapter was wildly different. We said, "So you were writing a romance, and now there are vampires." She said, "Yeah, I took a class at BYU, and the people in the class said, 'Vampires would be really good in this, and they're selling really well right now,' so I added them to the book." In the next chapter, they said, "Oh, it's not exciting enough. Thrillers are doing really well because *The DaVinci Code* had just come out." She thought, "Maybe I should make this a thriller." Her book was a different book in every chapter. Writing groups can do that to you. Now you're warned about it. Hopefully, that will inoculate you.

Number two: if you are getting feedback, try not to say anything. This is really hard. Your job getting feedback is to be a fly on the wall while people are talking about a story and write down what they say. In Hollywood, they do this cool thing where for years they would bring people in, show them a pilot for a new sitcom, and tell them, "We're going to ask you what you thought of it afterward." People would watch it. Afterward, they would say, "All right. Now there was a commercial at break number one. What brand was this commercial for?" They didn't want people to actually be paying attention to the commercials, just to the show. They'd use the same sitcom for years because it was just to test the commercials. They didn't want people to be too aware. You want to be like that. You don't want your audience, which is your writing group, to be aware of what you're planning to do.

If you defend yourself or ask too many questions, you will predispose them, and you will not get authentic feedback. The best thing you can do is stay quiet. Now, you are going to ask questions now and then. Try not to ask too many questions; just write down the feedback and use it later. Later is important. For most new writers, I recommend taking feedback on a book you've finished while you're writing something else, and then coming back to that feedback months later when you're in a revision mindset, reading through it all, and making a revision guide. Usually, I throw out—I take maybe a third of the feedback that I'm given, and I have a really good writing group. So you're not going to take most of it, but there's going to be a lot in there that will help you build this revision guide. Then you're going to revise your book. And then you're going to find a new audience and see if you fixed the things that you thought you fixed. This will be really good for you as a new writer learning to target people.

Write it down. If you are giving feedback, the last point of advice: be descriptive, not prescriptive. You want to describe the piece's impact on you through words, emotion words—not try to fix their book. Your job isn't to fix their book. Editors fix books. Beta readers and writing groups are just a test audience so that the author can tell what people are authentically feeling as they read the book. So you just say, "I really enjoyed this. This part was confusing. I wasn't emotionally connecting right here. I lost blocking right here." Not, as Janci got, "You should add rats with swords to this scene." Ask her about that if she ever comes and teaches the class.
