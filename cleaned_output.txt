Welcome to Introductory Calculus. I will start with some practical information, then I'll tell you about the syllabus and what we will cover in this course. I will then give you some examples of differential equations from the physical sciences, followed by a review of integration towards the end.

For many of you, this might be the easiest course you take here in Oxford, but things will get progressively harder. In a couple of weeks, it will be interesting to everyone, even if today's lecture might be too easy for some of you.

Let me share some practical information. We have 16 lectures. The lecture notes are online. These notes were written by Cath Wilkins, who taught this course for a few years until last year, so we will follow them.

I should introduce myself as the lecturer. You can call me Dan; my name is Dan Ciubotaru. We will meet twice a week. Today is special just because it's the first week. We'll meet on Mondays and Wednesdays at 10 AM, so not too early. You will have eight problem sheets. The first two problem sheets are online. You will cover the eight problem sheets in four tutorials in your college—four hours for tutorials.

As I said, the lecture notes are online, and the reading list is also online. The book I recommend is Mary Boas's *Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences*. Most of your colleges should have a copy of this, and if not, the university library does as well. This book is quite concise, and it has various examples from physics, engineering, and science. It also has the added advantage that, unlike the other books on the reading list, if you drop this one on your foot, you might be able to walk without seeing an orthopedic surgeon.

Alright, that covers the practical details. Any questions?

Now, for the syllabus: the first half of the course—about seven or eight lectures—will be devoted to differential equations. This will cover two kinds: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). I will give you some examples very soon. We will look at fairly easy examples of differential equations and learn some techniques for solving them. It is a combination of science and art—you have to make educated guesses at certain points—but it is quite an interesting and very useful subject. After that, we will talk about line and double integrals. These are useful because we will be able to compute arc lengths of curves and areas of various regions in the plane or surfaces. This will take maybe three lectures. Finally, we will cover the calculus of functions in two variables.

This should be viewed as a gentle introduction to multivariable calculus. Among the topics we will cover are various surfaces, gradient normal vectors, Taylor's theorem in two variables, critical points, and Lagrange multipliers, which are useful for optimization problems.

There is a lot of interaction between this course and other prelim courses that you will take. Introductory Calculus will be directly useful in Multivariable Calculus, as I said. In a way, it's a little bit unfair: we set up the groundwork and do some examples in Introductory Calculus, but the really cool results and theorems are proven in Multivariable Calculus. We just do the groundwork towards that. These concepts are also useful in Dynamics and in PDEs, which you will do next term (Fourier Series and PDEs).

There is also a lot of interaction between Introductory Calculus and Analysis, particularly Analysis 2, which you will do next term. There will be quite a few results from Analysis that I will state but not prove—we may prove some particular examples, but the rigorous proofs you will do in Analysis next term. It all comes together when you revise for your exams in Trinity.

Of course, in Part A, there will be lots of applied mathematics options that will continue this. Differential equations is a big option, as are Fluid and Waves, etc. This is a very useful course, and it is also mandatory, so you have to be here.

Now, let me give you some examples of where all these concepts might appear. What is an ordinary differential equation (ODE)? This is an equation involving an independent variable, let's call it $x$, and a function of $x$, which we call $y$. $y$ is the dependent variable, and the equation involves the derivatives of $y$ with respect to $x$ (for example, $dy/dx$, $d^2y/dx^2$, etc.). The order of the highest derivative that occurs is called the order of the differential equation.

For example, the simplest kind of ODE would be something of the form $dy/dx = f(x)$. You can solve that by direct integration, where $y$ is the antiderivative of $f$. That is the simplest kind of differential equation we can have, and this is why we will start the course by reviewing integration techniques.

But there can be more interesting differential equations, so let me give you some examples from the physical sciences. For instance, in mechanics—something you have all seen—we have Newton's second law, which states that force equals mass times acceleration ($F=ma$). Acceleration is a derivative—it is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. That is already a differential equation. It becomes a second-order differential equation if we consider that velocity $v = dr/dt$, where $r$ is the displacement. In that case, $a = d^2r/dt^2$, which is a second-order differential equation. That is an easy example of how differential equations appear in mechanics.

You could also have differential equations in engineering, such as in an electrical circuit. Consider a simple series RLC circuit, which means it has the following components: a resistor (R) with resistance $R$, an inductor (L) with inductance $L$, a capacitor (C) with capacitance $C$, and a source of voltage, a battery ($V$). $R$, $L$, and $C$ are constants independent of time. I am interested, for example, in the current $I$ across the circuit, which is a function of time $t$. In terms of differential equations, time $t$ is the independent variable, and $I$ is the dependent variable. I can also use $Q$, the charge on the capacitor, where $I = dQ/dt$. Kirchhoff's Law states that the total voltage around the circuit is zero. Another way of stating this is that the voltage $V(t)$ from the battery equals the sum of the voltages across the resistor, the inductor, and the capacitor.

Now we write each one of them. The voltage across the resistor, by Ohm's law, is $RI$. The voltage on the capacitor is $Q/C$. And for the inductor, it is $L (dI/dt)$, which is Faraday's Law. I now have an equation involving $V$, $I$, and $Q$. Since $I = dQ/dt$, I can rewrite everything in terms of $Q$. I get a differential equation in $Q$:

$$L \frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} Q = V.$$

That is a second-order differential equation that appears in electrical circuits. It is second-order because the highest derivative is of second order. It has constant coefficients because $R$, $L$, and $C$ are constant. And it is what we will call inhomogeneous because $V$ does not have to be zero.

Those are the types of differential equations we can study. There are many other examples, and I will leave one as an exercise for you. The problem is: the rate at which a radioactive substance decays is proportional to the remaining number of atoms. As an exercise, I want you to write a differential equation that describes this situation. We will come back to this later. The question is: what is the differential equation?

As you progress in the mathematics course here, you will encounter very interesting and sophisticated differential equations in applied mathematics. We are just scratching the surface.

Alright, going back to what I said before, the simplest kind of ODE is $dy/dx = f(x)$, which you can solve by integration. Let me review a couple of facts about integration.

One of the most useful techniques, which I'm sure most of you are familiar with, is integration by parts. Where does integration by parts come from? It comes from the product rule. If I have two functions, $f$ and $g$, and differentiate their product, $(fg)' = f'g + fg'$. This means $fg' = (fg)' - f'g$. If I integrate both sides, I arrive at the integration by parts formula:

$$\int f g' \, dx = fg - \int f'g \, dx$$

This is the indefinite integral version. You can also have a definite integral version where you put the limits of integration.

Suppose I want to integrate $\int x^2 \sin x \, dx$. This integral would provide the solution to $dy/dx = x^2 \sin x$. In integration by parts, you have to decide which one is $f$ and which one is $g'$. I choose $f=x^2$ to decrease the power, and $g'=\sin x$, which means $g=-\cos x$. If I call this integral $I$, $I = x^2 (-\cos x) - \int (2x)(-\cos x) \, dx$. This simplifies to $I = -x^2 \cos x + 2 \int x \cos x \, dx$.

We apply integration by parts again to $\int x \cos x \, dx$. This yields $x \sin x - \int \sin x \, dx$. The full integral $I$ becomes $I = -x^2 \cos x + 2 (x \sin x + \cos x) + C$. $C$ denotes a constant because we are doing indefinite integrals.

Let's do another example. An indefinite integral: $\int (2x-1) \ln(x^2+1) \, dx$. We choose $f = \ln(x^2+1)$ so we can differentiate to eliminate the logarithm, and $g' = 2x-1$, which means $g = x^2 - x$. This becomes:
$$(x^2 - x) \ln(x^2+1) - \int (x^2 - x) \left( \frac{2x}{x^2+1} \right) \, dx$$

We must perform long division on the integrand, $\int (2x^3 - 2x^2)/(x^2+1) \, dx$. Let's call the second integral $J$. After long division, $J = \int (2x-2) + (2x-2)/(x^2+1) \, dx$.

We split the fractional term:
$$J = \int (2x-2) \, dx + \int \frac{2x}{x^2+1} \, dx - \int \frac{2}{x^2+1} \, dx$$

The first term is $x^2 - 2x$. The last term is $2 \arctan(x)$. We use substitution for the middle term: if $u = x^2+1$, $du = 2x \, dx$, so $\int 2x/(x^2+1) \, dx = \ln(x^2+1)$.

Putting $J$ together: $J = x^2 - 2x + \ln(x^2+1) - 2 \arctan(x) + C_1$.

The original integral equals $(x^2 - x) \ln(x^2+1) - J$. We must combine the constant terms and distribute the negative sign.

There are cases when integration by parts will not simplify either of the two functions $f$ and $g'$, but if you do it twice, you return to the starting integral, allowing you to solve for $I$. The typical example is $I = \int e^x \sin x \, dx$. You solve this by integrating by parts twice and then solving the resulting algebraic equation for $I$.

Another type of example requires a recursive formula, also called a reduction formula. Suppose I am looking at the integral: $I_n = \int \cos^n x \, dx$. We write $I_n = \int \cos^{n-1} x \cos x \, dx$. Using integration by parts (with $f=\cos^{n-1} x$ and $g'=\cos x$), we derive:

$$I_n = \cos^{n-1} x \sin x + (n-1) \int \cos^{n-2} x \sin^2 x \, dx$$

We substitute $\sin^2 x = 1 - \cos^2 x$, which results in:
$$I_n = \cos^{n-1} x \sin x + (n-1) I_{n-2} - (n-1) I_n$$

Solving for $I_n$ gives the recursive formula:
$$I_n = \frac{1}{n} \cos^{n-1} x \sin x + \frac{n-1}{n} I_{n-2}$$

This is true for all $n \ge 2$. To use this formula, we need to know $I_0$ and $I_1$. $I_0 = \int 1 \, dx = x + C$, and $I_1 = \int \cos x \, dx = \sin x + C$. With these base cases, you can calculate any higher integral, $I_n$.

This is a quick review of integration by parts. If you are not fully comfortable with these or similar examples, get an integration textbook and practice more examples involving integration by parts, substitutions, and so on. When solving differential equations, we will learn many techniques, but ultimately, you will have to integrate certain functions, so you must be comfortable doing that. What we learn is how to reduce the problem to integrating various functions, but you have to be able to execute the integration.

We discussed the simplest kind of ODE, which can be solved just by direct integration. The next simplest are the so-called separable equations. We had the case $dy/dx = f(x)$. The next case is $dy/dx = a(x) b(y)$, where $a(x)$ is a function of $x$ only, and $b(y)$ is a function of $y$ only. If you have such a situation, you can reduce it to direct integration with one simple trick. If $b(y) \ne 0$, you divide by it and get $(1/b(y)) (dy/dx) = a(x)$. The variables are separated, and you can integrate both sides:

$$\int \frac{1}{b(y)} \, dy = \int a(x) \, dx$$

Now you have two direct integrations, which hopefully we can solve. The types of integrals we will encounter in this course will be those for which you can apply integration by parts or other standard techniques and solve them. If I wrote an arbitrary function and asked you to integrate it, we generally cannot do that in a closed formula.

Here's an example: find the general solution to the separable differential equation:
$$x (y^2-1) + y (x^2-1) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
We assume $x$ is between 0 and 1 to avoid some issues. We separate the variables:
$$y (x^2-1) \frac{dy}{dx} = -x (y^2-1)$$
$$\frac{y}{y^2-1} \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{x^2-1}$$
We integrate both sides:
$$\int \frac{y}{y^2-1} \, dy = \int \frac{-x}{x^2-1} \, dx$$
Both sides are solved by logarithms. The left-hand side is $1/2 \ln|y^2-1|$, and the right-hand side is $1/2 \ln|x^2-1| + C$. Since $x$ is between 0 and 1, $x^2-1$ is negative, so we can rewrite the integral on the right-hand side to manage the signs.

Using the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms:
$$\ln|y^2-1| + \ln|x^2-1| = 2C_1$$
$$\ln(|y^2-1||x^2-1|) = 2C_1$$
Taking the exponential yields $|y^2-1||x^2-1| = e^{2C_1}$. We can rename $e^{2C_1}$ as $C$, where $C > 0$. Since $x \in (0, 1)$, $x^2-1$ is negative, so $|x^2-1| = 1-x^2$. We can rewrite the solution as:
$$(1-y^2)(1-x^2) = C$$

We must address the case where the constant $C$ could be zero. We lost the case $C=0$ when we divided by $y^2-1$, ignoring the possibility that $y^2-1 = 0$. If $y = \pm 1$ (a constant function), then $dy/dx=0$, and the original equation is satisfied. If we allow $C=0$ in the final algebraic answer, then $y=\pm 1$ is included in the solution.

The bottom line is that the answer is this implicit equation in $y$ and $x$, where $C$ can be any non-negative constant. Be careful when you divide by the function in $y$. You can do that if you know it is not zero, but sometimes solutions arise from it being zero, so you have to be careful.

That's the end of the first lecture. I will see you tomorrow for the second lecture, and we will do more differential equations.
