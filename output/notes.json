The **order** of the ODE is determined by the highest derivative present. The simplest form, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)$, is solved simply by direct integration.\n\n### Physical Examples\n\n1.  **Mechanics (Newton's Second Law)**: Since force ($F$) equals mass ($m$) times acceleration ($a$), and acceleration is the second derivative of displacement ($r$):\n    $$ F(t) = m \\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} $$\n    This is generally a second-order ODE.\n\n2.  **RLC Electrical Circuit**: Applying Kirchhoff's Law relating voltage ($V$), current ($I$), resistance ($R$), inductance ($L$), and capacitance ($C$), where $I = dQ/dt$, yields a second-order linear ODE for charge $Q$:\n    $$ L \\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + R \\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}Q = V(t) $$\n\n*(Exercise: Radioactive decay rate is proportional to the remaining number of atoms.

      "content_block": "### Integration by Parts\nBased on the product rule $(fg)' = f'g + fg'$, integration by parts allows the integration of a product of two functions. The formula is:\n$$ \\int fg' dx = fg - \\int f'g dx $$\n\n**Example Application**: Solving $\\int x^2 \\sin(x) dx$.\n*   Let $f = x^2$ (easily differentiable) and $g' = \\sin(x)$ (easily integrable).\n*   Applying the formula results in: $-x^2 \\cos(x) + 2 \\int x \\cos(x) dx$.\n\n### Reduction Formulas\nThese recursive formulas allow complex integrals to be reduced to simpler forms. For $I_n = \\int \\cos^n(x) dx$, the reduction formula is:\n$$ I_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\cos^{n-1}(x)\\sin(x) + \\frac{n-1}{n}I_{n-2} $$\n\n### Separable Equations\nA first-order ODE $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is **separable** if it can be written as a product of a function of $x$ and a function of $y$: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = a(x)b(y)$.\n\n**Solution Method**:\n1.  Separate variables: $\\frac{1}{b(y)} dy = a(x) dx$\n2.  Integrate both sides: $\\int \\frac{1}{b(y)} dy = \\int a(x) dx$\n\n**Example Solution**: The separable equation $x(y^2-1) + y(x^2-1)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ has the general solution $(1-y^2)(1-x^2) = C$, where $C \\ge 0$.",
